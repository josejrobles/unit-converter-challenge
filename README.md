# Unit Converter Challenge
This project allows teachers to check their students assignments converting values from one unit of measurement to another. This currently only has two types of units.
Those being temperature units (Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, & Rankine) and volumetric units (liters, tablespoons, cubic-inches, cups, cubic-feet, gallons).
